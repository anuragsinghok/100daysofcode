"#100DaysOfCode
In this 100 Days of Code challenge, I will be revising and learning Python from the beginning, followed by data analysis. After completing the Python section, I'll share my progress here, with major updates posted on Twitter. Additionally, I plan to compile my learnings into YouTube videos.

Please note that there may be delays and occasional gaps in my daily coding due to ongoing college exams. Despite these interruptions, I am committed to continuing the challenge and completing it over the course of 100 days."
