#enumerate function 



# The enumerate function in Python converts a data collection object into an enumerate object. Enumerate returns an object that contains a counter as a key for each value within an object, making items within the collection easier to access

# Enumerate function in python
# The enumerate function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to loop over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and get the index and value of each element in the sequence at the same time. Here's a basic example of how it works:
# Loop over a list and print the index and value of
# each element


# marks = [12,34,23,566,543,34]

# index = 0
# for mark in marks:
#     print(mark)
#     if(index ==3):
#         print("harry, awesome!")
#         index+=1

# same above code we can do with the help of enumerate function
marks = [12,34,23,566,543,34] # we can use it for string  and tuple also


for index,  mark in enumerate(marks):
    print(mark)
    if(index ==3):
        print("harry, awesome!")
        

fruit = ['apple','banana','mango']
for index ,fruits in enumerate(fruit ):
# for index ,fruits in enumerate(fruit , start =1):# it will start from 1 directly by default it start from zero 
    print(index , fruits)
    # enumerate basically index provide kr deta and element ki sequence btata hai
