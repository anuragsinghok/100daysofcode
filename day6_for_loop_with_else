# we can use for loop with else
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("sorry no i")

# Python - else in Loop
# As you have learned before, the else clause is used along with the if statement.
# Python allows the else keyword to be used with the for and while loops too. 
# The else block appears after the body of the loop. 
# The statements in the else block will be executed after all iterations are completed. 
# The program exits the loop only after the else block is executed


# you can use else with for loop and while loop and the statement in the 
# else block will be executed after all iterations are completed


for i in range(6):
    print(i)
    if i ==4:
     break

else:
   print("sorry no i ")
# this example shows  ki else tbhi run hoga jb code of for and while loop successfully ktm hoga break nhi successfull run hoke ktm hoga
