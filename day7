#exception handling

# Exception Handling
# Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.
# Exceptions in Python
# Python has many built-in exceptions that are raised when your program encounters an error (something in the program goes wrong).
# When these exceptions occur, the Python interpreter stops the current process and passes it to the calling process until it is handled. If not handled, the program will crash.

a = input("enter the number: ")
print(f"multiplication table of {a} is : ")

try:
  for i in range(1,11):
     print(f"{int(a)} X {i} = {int(a)*i}")

# except Exception as e: # error as agr error agya to error bta k nuche ka code run hoga easly
#    print(e)
except: #simple exception
   print("invalid input")

print("some line of code ")
print("End of program")

# means basically agar code successfully run ho rha hai to run ho agr error ane ki smbavna hai to errror ki jagah kuch aur ho jye 

#and jaha error ane ki smbavna ho waha try lga do
