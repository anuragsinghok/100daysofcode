# os Module in Python
# The os module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as reading and writing files, interacting with the file system, and running system commands.
# Here are some common tasks you can perform with the os module:
# Reading and writing files The os module provides functions for opening, reading, and writing files.
# For example, to open a file for reading, you can use the open function:

import os
# Open the file in read-only mode
f = os. open("myfile. txt", os.o_RDONLY)
# Read the contents of the file
contents = os. read(f, 1024)
# Close the file
os.close()


if (not os.path.exist("data")):#these line of codes wil create 100 folders in directory or folder in fraction of seconds it basically make things easy and create folder directory managing tasks easyly
    os.mkdir("data")
for i in range(0,100):
    os.mkdir(f"data/day{i+1}")


# os.rename(source,destination)  #it will rename the files 
#example:
for i in range(0,100):
    os.rename(f"data/day{i+1}",f"data/tutorail{i+1}")


# important function which will tell ki data ke ander kon kon si list hai 
import os 
folders =os.listdir("data")

print(folders)

for folder in folders:
    print(folder)
