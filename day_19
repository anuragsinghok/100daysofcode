# Python Class and Objects
# A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.
# Creating a Class:
# Let us now create a class using the class keyword.

# class Details:
# name = "Rohan"
# age = 20

# Creating an Object:
# Object is the instance of the class used to access the properties of the class Now lets create an object of the class.

class person:
    name = "Anurag" 
    occupation = "software Devloper"
    networth =  10
    def info(self):# self means wo object pe ye method call ho rha hai 
        print(f"{self.name} is a {self.occupation}")
        # class is like a blue print it is a user defined control

a =  person()
a.name = "shubham" # changing vaule easily
a.occupation = "Accountant"
print(a.name , a. occupation) 
a.info() # like yaha a obj ke liye self call ho rha hai
