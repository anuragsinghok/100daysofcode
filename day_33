# Hybrid Inheritance in Python

# Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming. It is a type of inheritance in which multiple inheritance is used to inherit the properties of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.
# In Python, hybrid inheritance can be implemented by creating a class hierarchy, in which a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes, and one of the derived classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.

class Baseclass:
    pass
class Derived1(Baseclass):
    pass
class Derived2(Baseclass):
    pass
class derived3(Derived1,Derived2):
    pass
# combination of single and mutiple inheritance is called hybrid inheritence


# Hierarchical Inheritance

# Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where multigle subclasses inherit from a single base class. In other words, a single base class acts as a parent class for multiple subclasses. This is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical Manner.

class Baseclass:
    pass
class Derived1(Baseclass):
    pass
class Derived2(Baseclass):
    pass
class Derived3(Derived1):
    pass
class Derived4(Derived2):
    pass
class derived5(Derived3):
    pass
# ek hierarchy bnti chali jati hai like ceo uske under manager, pd, etc
